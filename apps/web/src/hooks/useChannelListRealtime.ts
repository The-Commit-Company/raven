/**
 * Keeps the channel list and per-channel member lists fresh from realtime.
 *
 *  - channel_list_updated: a channel was created / archived / deleted, or the
 *    current user joined or left one. The payload carries only channel_id (not
 *    the channel data), so we revalidate the whole list rather than patch — and
 *    get_all_channels already filters to the user's channels.
 *  - channel_members_updated: a channel's (or thread's — common to both) membership
 *    changed. Refetch that id's member list in the channelMembersStore, but ONLY if it's
 *    already loaded — we never build member lists for threads the user hasn't opened.
 *
 * The channel list cache (SWR) and the member store are shared app-wide, so this is
 * mounted once at the shell.
