/**
 * The scroll viewport that in-view detection is measured against — a stream's scroll
 * container, supplied by ChatStream (and later the notifications list). Null falls back
 * to the browser viewport.
 *
 * Why the container and not `root: null`: an IntersectionObserver clips the target by
 * its scroll ancestors, so a scrolled-out message reads as not-visible either way — BUT
 * `rootMargin` prefetch only works when the margin extends the *scroll container's*
 * bounds. With `root: null` a scrolled-out row is clipped to an empty rect, so no margin
 * can pre-trigger it. Rooting at the container is what makes "fetch ~200px early" work.

 * Latches true the first time the element scrolls into (or near) the viewport, then

 * skeleton until `hasBeenInView`, then mounts the data-fetching child — so a polls /
 * threads channel fetches only what the user actually sees, not all ~30 windowed
 * messages. (Latching + SWR's cache means scroll-out/in never re-fetches.)
 *
 * For a live "currently visible" need (e.g. clearing notifications when seen), add a
 * non-latching sibling later — this one freezes by design.
