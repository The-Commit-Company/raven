/**
 * True while the on-screen keyboard is (likely) open *for the given composer editor*.
 *
 * iOS keeps `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` reporting the home-indicator inset even when the
 * keyboard covers that area, so composer padding meant to clear the indicator turns into dead
 * space floating above the keyboard. Consumers drop that padding when this returns true.
 *
 * Scoped + blur-accurate by design: the primary signal is the editor's own focus (`editor.isFocused`
 * driven by its `focus`/`blur` events), so in a browser an unrelated input elsewhere on screen
 * can't flip it (on native the keyboard plugin's show/hide events are authoritative), and
 * ProseMirror's reliable `blur` event is the backstop that restores the padding. The visualViewport
 * shrink is a secondary signal — pure viewport math is flaky in a standalone iOS PWA (innerHeight can
 * shrink with the keyboard, and page scroll eats the gap), so it's an OR, not the source of truth.
 *
 * Pass `enabled: false` (e.g. on desktop, where the result is unused) to skip the focus +
 * visualViewport listeners entirely — it just returns false.
