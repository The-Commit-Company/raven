/**
 * Runtime recovery from a DEAD SESSION. The boot-time login check in App.tsx
 * only runs once, so a session that expires while the app is open (or an
 * expired session behind the service-worker-cached app shell) would otherwise
 * strand every page on skeletons with no way out.
 *
 * The detector is the user_id cookie, and the server itself keeps it honest:
 * when Frappe fails to resume an expired session it becomes Guest for that
 * request and REWRITES user_id to "Guest" on that very response (LoginManager's
 * resume-failure branch → set_user_info → set_cookie; cookies are flushed even
 * on error responses). So after any failed request, the cookie already carries
 * the server's verdict — no extra "are you alive" request needed. A failure
 * that never reached Frappe (network down, proxy error) leaves the cookie
 * untouched and we correctly do nothing but keep retrying.
