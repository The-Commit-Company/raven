/**
 * Anatomy of a message
 *
 * A message "stream" is a list of messages separated by dates
 *
 * A date block is a simple divider with a date. Any message below the divider was sent on this date.
 * Two date blocks can never be adjacent to each other.
 *
 * A message block can be of multiple types depending on the message type + who sent it and when.
 *
 * If two messages are sent by the same person within 2 minutes of each other, they are grouped together.
 * The first message in such a group will have a User Avatar, Name and timestamp, and the rest will not.
 * Subsequent message blocks in this 'mini-block' will only show a timestamp on hover.
 *
 * The message block can be of the following types:
 * 1. Image - this will show a preview of the image. Clicking on it will open the image in a modal.
 * 2. File - this will show a small box with the file name with actions to copy the link or download the file.
 *      PDF - PDF files will also have an action to open the file in a modal.
 *      Video - A video file will have a preview of the video.
 * 3. Text - this will show the text message in a tiptap renderer. A text block can have multiple elements
 *     1. Text - this will show the text as is (p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, blockquote, li, ul, ol)
 *     2. Code - this will show in a container with a quick action button to copy it
 *     3. Mention - this will show the mentioned user's name (highlighted) and hovering over them should show a card with their details
 *
 * A message can also be a reply to another message. In this case, the message will have a small box at the top with the message content and a click will jump to the message.
 *
 * Every message has reactions at the very bottom. Every reaction has a count and a list of users who reacted to it.
 *
 * Every message will have a context menu (right click) with the following options:
 * 1. Reply - this will open the reply box with the message quoted
 * 2. Edit - this will open the edit box with the message content
 * 3. Delete - this will delete the message
 * 4. Copy - this will copy the message content
 * 5. Copy Link - this will copy the message link (if file)
 * 6. Send in an email
 * 7. Link with document
 * 8. Bookmark
 *
 * Every message will have a hover menu with the following options:
 * 1. Reaction emojis with the frequently used emojis for that user on this channel
 * 2. Reply/Edit depending on the user
 * 3. Ellipsis to open the context menu
 *
