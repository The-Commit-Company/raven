/**
 * Shared scaffold for the admin-facing Raven Settings panels (AI, HR, Notifications).
 * Handles the whole lifecycle: fetch the single doc, seed the form once it loads,
 * gate editing behind the admin role, save via updateDoc (merging with the current
 * doc so untouched fields aren't wiped), and mutate the cache. Panels just supply
 * their fields as children — they read form state through useFormContext.
 *
 * `children` is a NODE, not a render prop taking the form. It used to be
 * `(form) => ReactNode`, with panels calling `form.watch(...)` inside it to show or hide
 * dependent fields — and those fields never appeared when you flicked their switch. They
 * showed up only after a save, because saving toggles the button's `loading` flag, and
 * that unrelated re-render was what refreshed them.
 *
 * The cause is React Compiler: disabling it made the same code work, which is what
 * pinned it. A render prop invoked with referentially stable arguments is a memoization
 * candidate, so its result can be reused instead of re-evaluated. Panels now read form
 * state with useFormContext/useWatch inside their own component, where the subscription
 * belongs to the component that renders the fields.
 *
 * The Save button lives in the panel header (outside the <form>), wired by `form`
 * id — same pattern as the Profile panel.
