/**
 * Decides what to show where the composer goes, for a channel, DM, or thread (a thread is a
 * channel too). Membership comes from useChannelMembers (store-backed — works for any channel
 * you can view, unlike the channel store which only lists channels you're IN). Rules:
 *  - while the channel list / members are still loading → `loading` (caller shows a skeleton,
 *    so a refresh doesn't flash the composer then the banner)
 *  - archived channel → `archived`
 *  - Open channel (not archived) → `composer`, even if you're not a member yet (posting joins)
 *  - otherwise not a member → `not-member` (caller shows a Join button — unless
 *    `canJoin` is false, see below)
 *  - else → `composer`
 * DMs short-circuit to member (you're always in your DM; skip the member fetch).
 *
 * THREADS (`isThread` + `parentChannelID`): joining a thread requires membership
 * of its PARENT channel. A non-member of a public channel can VIEW its threads
 * but not join them — `canJoin` comes back false and the banner renders without
 * its Join button (view only).
