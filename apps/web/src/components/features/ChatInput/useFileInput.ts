/**
 * 
 * For file uploads, we need to consider a few scenarios:
 * 
 * 1. User selects multiple files, but then hits the send button. Some files were uploaded, some were still inflight.
 * In such a case, we hold the send (pendingSendAtom) and dispatch it once every upload settles.
 *
 * 2. User selects a file and it's being uploaded but the user then closes the tab - in this case we lose the file (acceptable)
 * 3. User selects a file and it's being uploaded - the user can switch channels when the file is being uploaded and resume once back
 * 4. User selects a file and it's uploaded - then the user refreshes the tab - the user should still see the file in the chat input.
 * 
 * To cater to the above:
 *
 * 1. Maintain a local state for all files that are being uploaded (uploadingFilesAtom) (3)
 * 2. Maintain a local state for all files that are uploaded (uploadedFilesAtom) - which is persisted in local storage (4)
 * 3. When a file finishes uploading, move it from uploadingFilesAtom to uploadedFilesAtom (1)
 * 4. The send is held (pendingSendAtom) while anything is still uploading; ChatInput
 *    watches uploadingFilesAtom and dispatches the held send once every upload settles (1)
