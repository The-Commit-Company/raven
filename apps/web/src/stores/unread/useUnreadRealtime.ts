/**
 * Single handler for the channel-activity signal. The event carries no count —
 * it's a "something changed in channel X" ping — and drives two independent
 * updates off the one subscription:
 *
 *  1. Unread counts (store). Someone else posted -> increment (the store applies
 *     the timestamp guard and exempts the channel being actively read). Our own
 *     post, or a read echoed from another device -> advance the watermark so this
 *     session agrees and later bumps below it are ignored. No per-event refetch
 *     (v2's slow path, which raced reads).
 *
 *  2. DM list preview (channelStore). DM message events carry the new
 *     last_message_details + timestamp, so the sidebar's preview text and date
 *     update live — patched straight into the channel store (single writer; the
 *     sidebar re-sorts by timestamp). Only events that actually carry details patch
 *     the channel — that excludes read-echoes (track_visit) and plain non-DM channel
 *     pings, neither of which should rewrite a channel's last-message fields.
 *
 * Thread activity rides a separate `thread_reply` event and its own unread count
 * (threads are excluded from get_unread_count_for_channels), so it isn't here.
 * 
 * * A "raven:unread_channel_count_updated" event is sent by the backend for a channel when:
 * 1. A new message is sent
 * 2. A message is deleted
 * 3. The user calls the track_visit API and this signal is broadcast to other tabs to update the last visit timestamp for the channel for the user
 * 
 * So when an event like this comes in - and it has details about the last message (complete in case of DMs - user scoped),
 * or just the timestamp in case of regular channels - we can update the last message timestamp for the channel in the channelStore for sorting
 * 
 * When an event comes in from someone else - it can either be because a new message was sent, or a message was deleted.
 * If a new message was sent - it's timestamp will definitely be greater than the last visit timestamp we have locally - so we can increment by one
 * If a message was deleted, the latest message timestamp sent by the server may or may not be greater than the last visit timestamp we have locally.
 * So we cannot increment by one in this case. Hence, the backend now sends the event_type as "message_deleted" in case of a message deletion.
