 * and onSuccess. FRESHNESS is ours: leave is a daily fact with no socket event,
 * so one focus/visibility listener applies the whole policy — refetch when the
 * data is older than 6h or from a previous org day. mutate() bypasses SWR's
 * dedupe, so this check is the only throttle on the focus path. (A tab left
 * visible and untouched across midnight gets no event; it catches up on the
 * first interaction.)
 *
 * Skipped entirely when HRMS isn't installed (the API just returns [], so don't
 * bother calling). The backend also gates on the `show_if_a_user_is_on_leave`
 * Raven Setting; when that's off the list is empty and every useIsUserOnLeave
 * reads false.
