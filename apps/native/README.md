# @raven/native

Capacitor project for the Raven iOS and Android apps. The web content is a
native-mode build of `apps/web` (`VITE_NATIVE=1`, output `apps/web/dist-native`),
served from the app's own origin and working offline. Design:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-09-native-bundled-design.md`.

## Build & run

```bash
yarn native:build     # apps/web native build → apps/web/dist-native
yarn native:sync      # build + cap sync
yarn native:ios       # cap open → Xcode
yarn native:android   # cap open → Android Studio
cd apps/native && npx cap run android --target <avd>
cd apps/native && npx cap run ios --target <udid>
```

## Local files (gitignored)

- `android/app/google-services.json`, `ios/App/App/GoogleService-Info.plist`: Firebase.
- `android/local.properties`: SDK path.
- `capacitor.config.local.json`: dev overrides, e.g. `server.androidScheme: "http"` so
  the emulator can call a plain-http bench.

## Native sources

- Android: `MainActivity` (system-bar insets, theme canvas, launch-intent replay guard),
  `RavenApplication` (night mode, notification channel), `RavenShellPlugin`
  (foreground notifications, share intake), `ConversationNotification`.
- iOS: `RavenBridgeViewController` (plugin registration, canvas), `SceneDelegate`
  (theme, share extension handoff), `AppDelegate` (APNs token), `RavenShellPlugin`.

Layer 1 of the bundled design: the app boots to a placeholder from `apps/web`.

## Sites and sign-in

- A site is added by origin; the app calls `raven.api.native.handshake` (guest) and
  refuses sites that predate it, sites whose `min_app_version` is newer than the app,
  and sites without an OAuth client that lists `raven.thecommit.company://oauth`.
- Sign-in is OAuth PKCE in the system browser (`@capacitor/browser`); tokens live in the
  keychain per site (`raven.tokens.<origin>`) and are refreshed at 80% of their lifetime
  and once more on a 401. A failed refresh returns to the picker with the site kept.
- API calls use the sdk with a bearer token; the site allows the app's origins through
  `raven.api.native.set_cors` (`before_request`), so sites need no CORS configuration.
- Set up once per site (Raven Settings → OAuth Client):
  `bench --site <site> execute raven.api.raven_mobile.create_oauth_client`.
- Local bench: add `http://10.0.2.2:8004` on the emulator, `http://127.0.0.1:8004` on the
  simulator (ATS exception in `Info.plist`); the site's `developer_mode` allows the
  `http://localhost` origin.

## The app on a remote site

- `src/lib/site.ts` holds the active site: `siteUrl` for site-relative paths, `siteKey` and
  `siteStorage` for per-site localStorage, `siteFetch` for fetches with the bearer token.
  In the browser all of them are the identity.
- Boot comes from `raven.api.native.boot` (`src/native/appBoot.ts`) and the last good copy
  is kept per site for offline starts. The current user comes from boot through
  `src/lib/sessionUser.ts`, which replaces the Frappe cookies.
- Private files (`/private/files/`) cannot carry the token on an `<img>`; `useFileSrc` and
  `FileImage` fetch them with the token into object URLs. Public paths only get the site
  prefix.
- The emoji data file is bundled (`dist-native/emojis.json`); the site's `/assets` are
  served without CORS headers.
- Switch site and log out live on the Profile page.
- Realtime runs through a native socket.io client (`RavenSocketPlugin`, Java and Swift)
  bridged into the sdk's context (`src/native/nativeSocket.ts`). Frappe's realtime server
  only accepts a socket whose `Origin` is the site and calls the site back on that origin,
  which a WebView cannot send; the native client sets `Origin`, `Authorization`, and
  `X-Frappe-Site-Name` itself.
- Local bench on the emulator: `adb reverse tcp:8004 tcp:8004` and `tcp:9004`, then add the
  site as `http://127.0.0.1:8004`. The socket server calls the site back on the origin the
  client sends: `10.0.2.2` is not routable from the host, and the bench's Node resolves
  `localhost` to `::1`, where nothing listens.
