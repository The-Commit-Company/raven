# @raven/native

Capacitor shell for the Raven native apps (iOS + Android).

## Overview

The shell bundles only a site picker. It navigates the WebView to
`https://<site>/raven`; the Capacitor bridge is injected there and the web app
(`apps/web/src/native/`) does all plugin calls.

`server.allowNavigation: ["*"]` is only there because the saved-site list is
dynamic. The shell's own plugin (`RavenShellPlugin`, iOS + Android) gates every
main-frame http(s) navigation: saved sites and the shell load in the WebView,
anything else opens in the system browser. Do not widen that gate — every page
that loads in the WebView gets the full plugin bridge, including the keychain
tokens. Its JS contract lives in `packages/lib/utils/ravenShell.ts`.

## Before first store submission

Checklist — the store versions must be higher than the RN listing (1.1.4):

- App icons + splash art: done. Android uses vector drawables (`drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml`,
  `drawable/splash.xml`) built from `raven/public/raven_logo.svg`; the legacy `mipmap-*/ic_launcher*.png`
  (Android 7) and the iOS 1024 icon + two splash images were exported from the same SVG.
- Versions: 2.0.0 / build 200 (already set in `project.pbxproj` and
  `android/app/build.gradle`).
- Verify the archived .ipa entitlement `aps-environment=production`.
- Apple Push capability on the App ID `raven.thecommit.company`.
- iOS share extension wired (manual step 2).
- Android release keystore generated and referenced (manual step 3).
- Run the manual test matrix below, including Camera, on a real device.

## Prerequisites

- Node / Yarn 1 (monorepo workspaces)
- Xcode + Swift Package Manager (the generated project uses SPM: `ios/App/CapApp-SPM`)
- Android Studio (Android)

## Build & run

```bash
yarn native:build    # vite build of the picker → apps/native/dist
yarn native:sync     # build + cap sync
yarn native:ios      # cap open → Xcode
yarn native:android  # cap open → Android Studio
yarn native:test     # vitest
```

Direct run (device):
```bash
cd apps/native && npx cap run ios --target <udid>
cd apps/native && npx cap run android --target <avd>
```

## What is already wired

Committed native projects already include:

- iOS: `GoogleService-Info.plist` is a member of the Xcode App target.
- iOS: `App.entitlements` (`aps-environment`) via `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS`;
  `UIBackgroundModes: remote-notification`.
- Android: `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` and `CAMERA` permissions; iOS: camera and
  microphone usage strings (the composer's capture inputs need both).
- Android: SEND/SEND_MULTIPLE filters on `MainActivity` (`singleTask`), read by
  `RavenShellPlugin` — not send-intent's own `SendIntentActivity`, which is a
  second `BridgeActivity` where the shell plugin would be missing. send-intent
  is still used for the iOS share extension.
- Android: `android/build.gradle` forces `compileSdkVersion 36` on subprojects
  (send-intent@7 targets 35).
- Picker built with `target: es2017` (old Android WebViews reject optional
  chaining).
- Android back on a root page (workspace home, DMs, threads, notifications,
  profile) returns to the picker with the session kept, like the "Switch site"
  row on the mobile Profile page. Deeper pages go one step back in history.
- A push that arrives while the app is in the foreground is not shown by the OS
  (iOS: `presentationOptions []`); the page re-posts the ones from another saved
  site through `RavenShell.showNotification` (`apps/web/src/native/push.ts`). Its
  tap reaches the messaging plugin's `notificationActionPerformed` on both
  platforms (Android: FCM extras on the intent; iOS: the shell is the local
  notification handler and forwards to the push handler).
- Android: `MainActivity` pads the WebView by the system-bar insets itself
  (`SystemBars.insetsHandling: "disable"`, `StatusBar.overlaysWebView: false`).
  Capacitor's default hands the insets to the page as CSS variables, which a
  site running an older bundle never reads, so it would draw under the status
  and gesture bars. On Android the page's `--safe-area-inset-*` are therefore 0;
  iOS keeps `env()` and the `.native #root` padding.

## OAuth sign-in

The picker signs in through the system browser when the site has an OAuth
client. Tokens live in the iOS/Android keychain (SecureStorage).

- The flow runs in `@capacitor/browser`: `SFSafariViewController` on iOS
  (AutoFill and passkeys work, but Safari's own cookies / SSO sessions are NOT
  shared with the app) and Custom Tabs on Android.
- PKCE (S256) is implemented in the shell itself (`src/pkce.ts`, `src/auth.ts`)
  — no third-party OAuth plugin. The redirect
  `raven.thecommit.company://oauth` is delivered through Capacitor
  `App.appUrlOpen`; token exchange / refresh / revoke run natively via
  `CapacitorHttp`.
- The first sign-in shows Frappe's "Confirm Access" consent page: the client is
  created without `skip_authorization`.
- Keychain items are protected with `afterFirstUnlock`, so they survive an
  encrypted backup.
- Opening a site from the picker goes through `reauth`: a stored refresh token
  is exchanged silently and posted to `login_with_token`; the system browser is
  opened for OAuth only when there is no token. "Switch site" keeps the session,
  tokens and push subscription, so coming back is silent too.
- `login_with_token` is a top-level POST. Frappe CSRF-rejects it when the
  WebView still holds a live `sid` for that site, so the shell expires the
  site's cookies (`RavenShell.clearSiteCookies`) right before posting.

Sites running a Raven without `raven.api.native_auth` report no `native_login`
flag from `get_client_id`, so the shell skips OAuth there and uses the site's
web login page inside the WebView instead.

Set up once per site (Raven Settings → OAuth Client):

```bash
bench --site <site> execute raven.api.raven_mobile.create_oauth_client
```

Sites without a client fall back to the in-WebView login page. The web app
uses the shell origin when it needs to return control: on iOS it navigates to
`capacitor://localhost/?relogin=<site origin>&to=<path>` and on Android to
`https://localhost/?relogin=<site origin>&to=<path>`; the same applies for
`?signout=<site origin>`. These are user-visible recoveries, so they bypass the
splash auto-nav. `raven.thecommit.company://oauth` is only the OAuth redirect URI.
The RN app's bare `raven.thecommit.company:` loses its query in Foundation's URL
parser, so the client lists both; the `add_native_oauth_redirect` patch adds the
new one to clients created earlier. On Android the redirect is received by
`MainActivity`'s VIEW intent-filter (scheme + host, `singleTask` → `appUrlOpen`);
on iOS by `CFBundleURLTypes`.

To test silent re-login, quit the app first, then kill the session server-side:
`bench --site <site> execute frappe.sessions.clear_sessions --kwargs '{"user":"<user>","force":True}'`
followed by `bench --site <site> execute frappe.cache.delete_key --args '["session"]'`.
An open app re-saves its session to Redis after the `tabSessions` row is gone
(Frappe `Session.update`), and Redis-only sessions resume indefinitely while
`clear_sessions` only reads the table — so clearing sessions while the app is
open has no effect.

## Manual steps

Not scriptable — do once per environment:

1. Apple developer portal: enable Push Notifications on App ID
   `raven.thecommit.company`; select the signing team in Xcode.
2. iOS share-in: create a Share Extension target named `RavenShare` in Xcode
   with app group `group.raven.thecommit.company`, following the send-intent
   README "iOS" section (`node_modules/send-intent/README.md`):
   - (a) Add a URL scheme `raven` to the main app `Info.plist`
     `CFBundleURLTypes`.
   - (b) Add `com.apple.security.application-groups` =
     `group.raven.thecommit.company` to BOTH `App.entitlements` and the
     extension's entitlements.
   - (c) The `NSExtensionActivationRule` block from the send-intent README
     (lines ~96-113).
   - (d) The `RavenShare` target + ShareViewController snippet as written
     there. Skip its AppDelegate snippet: this app is scene-based, so the
     `raven://` handoff is already handled in `SceneDelegate.swift`
     (`scene(_:openURLContexts:)` fills send-intent's `ShareStore`).
3. Android release signing (keystore) is not in the repo.

## Firebase config files

`android/app/google-services.json` and `ios/App/App/GoogleService-Info.plist`
are gitignored. Download both for the app `raven.thecommit.company` from the
Firebase console (project `raven-c2659`) and put them at those paths. Android
builds without the JSON (the Gradle script skips the google-services plugin and
push stays off); the iOS target lists the plist as a resource, so Xcode fails
until it is present. CI must inject both before building.

## Developing against a local site

Production talks https only; the committed config allows no cleartext. Local
dev overrides live in two gitignored files, absent on CI and fresh checkouts,
so release builds keep the https-only config:

- `capacitor.config.local.json` — merged into `capacitor.config.ts` at
  `cap sync` time (a warning line is printed when applied):

  ```json
  {
      "server": { "allowNavigation": ["*", "http://10.0.2.2:8004", "http://127.0.0.1:8004"], "cleartext": true },
      "android": { "allowMixedContent": true }
  }
  ```

  `cleartext` lets CapacitorHttp reach an http site, `allowMixedContent` lets
  the WebView navigate to one, and the explicit `http://10.0.2.2:<port>` rule
  is needed because Capacitor turns scheme-less `allowNavigation` entries into
  `https://…` origin rules. Re-run `npx cap sync` after editing. If you build
  a release binary on a machine that has this file, run a sync with the file
  renamed first — the values are written into the native projects at sync time.

On Android, `server.cleartext: true` also makes `cap sync` write
`android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` into the generated (gitignored)
`capacitor-cordova-android-plugins` manifest, so no manifest edit is needed —
and a sync without the local file removes it again.

The emulator reaches the host at `10.0.2.2`; the iOS simulator uses
`localhost` (`Info.plist` ships `NSAllowsLocalNetworking`, which only relaxes
ATS for local hosts). Use an API 34+ Android image — the stock API 28/30
images ship WebView 66, which cannot run the v3 bundle.

Realtime on the Android emulator: Frappe's socket server resolves the site from
the page's Origin hostname (or `default_site` for `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`), so a
site added as `http://10.0.2.2:8004` connects but is rejected with "Invalid
namespace". Map the host ports into the emulator instead and add the site as
`http://127.0.0.1:8004` — not `localhost`, which Capacitor's asset server
intercepts on every port:
`adb reverse tcp:8004 tcp:8004 && adb reverse tcp:9004 tcp:9004`
(the mapping is dropped by `cap run` and emulator restarts — re-run it). Put
`http://127.0.0.1:8004` in the local override's `allowNavigation` as well. The
iOS simulator already uses `localhost`.

To test over real https with no overrides at all, tunnel the bench:
`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8004` and add the printed URL in
the picker.

## Release

- iOS: bump `CFBundleShortVersionString` in the Xcode project, then Archive +
  upload.
- Android: bump Android `versionName`, generate a signed APK/AAB and upload.
- Plugin JS in apps/web and plugin native code in the shell are coupled —
  bumping any @capacitor* version in apps/web needs a matching store release.

## iOS back-swipe

`RavenBridgeViewController` (the storyboard's root, subclassing
`CAPBridgeViewController`) turns on `allowsBackForwardNavigationGestures` —
WKWebView leaves it off, while installed PWAs get the edge swipe from iOS.
The web app's `useMobileBack` treats it as a normal `history.back()`.

## RavenShell plugin

`apps/native/android/.../RavenShellPlugin.java` and
`apps/native/ios/App/App/RavenShellPlugin.swift`; contract in
`packages/lib/utils/ravenShell.ts`.

- Navigation gate (both): main-frame http(s) loads are allowed only for the
  saved sites (`Preferences` key `sites`) and the shell origin; everything else
  is handed to the system browser. Sub-frames keep Capacitor's default policy.
  Android checks twice — `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` never fires for POSTs, so
  `shouldInterceptRequest` answers a blank 403 for a blocked main-frame POST.
  Origins must match exactly, redirects included, which is why `validateSite`
  saves the origin the site actually answered from (apex → www, http → https).
- Android bridge on the saved sites: Capacitor 8 registers its bridge script
  (`addDocumentStartJavaScript`) for the app origin only, so remote pages would
  get no `window.Capacitor`. The plugin registers the same script for the saved
  site origins (reaching `Bridge.getJSInjector()` by reflection) and re-registers
  on `syncAllowedOrigins()`, which `sites.ts` calls after every save/remove.
  After a Capacitor upgrade, check that `isNativePlatform()` is still true on a
  remote page (Chrome DevTools → `chrome://inspect`). iOS needs nothing: the
  bridge is a `WKUserScript`, which runs on every main-frame document.
- Share intents (Android): `getShareIntent()` reads `MainActivity`'s SEND
  intent (all items of a SEND_MULTIPLE, each `content://` copied into the app
  cache so the stash survives the activity's URI grant), `clearShareIntent()`
  forgets it, and a warm share fires the `shareReceived` event from
  `onNewIntent`. `MainActivity.onCreate` drops a SEND intent that comes back
  with a saved state or `FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCHED_FROM_HISTORY` — Android
  re-delivers the task's root intent after process death, which would replay
  an already-sent share. The web app also re-reads on mount and on every
  foreground (iOS keeps a share in send-intent's store until read).
- `clearSiteCookies({ url })`: expires one site's WebView cookies before
  `login_with_token` — host-only and every parent-`Domain` form, since a
  proxy may set `sid` with a Domain attribute.
- Removing a site in the picker unsubscribes its push row (the web app mirrors
  the FCM token per site under `pushToken.<origin>`, sent with the OAuth
  bearer) and revokes its tokens; "Switch site" keeps everything.

Theme changes on Android are applied through `onConfigurationChanged`
(`uiMode` is in `configChanges`); never `recreate()` the activity — a recreate
reloads the WebView from the shell URL and drops the page the user was on.

## Known limitations

- If a saved site fails to load on launch, the WebView's error page sits behind the
  splash; the next launch (within 15 s) falls back to the picker with an error line.

- No service worker inside the WebView (push handled natively).
- WebView default error page when a site is down.
- Android WebView persists cookies asynchronously — a kill within seconds of
  login can lose the session (real users unaffected).
- A site's "Login with Google/GitHub" button (in-WebView login page, sites
  without an OAuth client) leaves the WebView: the provider's page is not a
  saved site, so the gate opens it in the system browser and the session ends
  up there. Provision the OAuth client instead.
- iOS: the gate covers main-frame loads. An iframe on a saved site can still
  post to Capacitor's message handler (Capacitor's default; Android rejects
  sub-frame posts). Only saved sites can embed such an iframe.
- Android WebView older than 89: the per-origin bridge script cannot be
  registered, and Capacitor's local server injects the bridge into every HTML
  page it proxies instead. Such WebViews cannot run the v3 bundle anyway.
